<#### Kill-Port-3000.ps1 ####>
# Purpose: Forcefully terminate any process currently listening on TCP port 3000.
# Usage   : Run from PowerShell ->  ./kill-port-3000.ps1
#           (No admin rights required for stopping owned processes; admin may
#            be necessary for system-owned ones.)
# ----------
# How it works:
#   1. Finds active TCP listeners on the requested port (default 3000).
#   2. Extracts the owning process IDs.
#   3. Iterates over each PID and stops it with `Stop-Process -Force`.
#   4. Logs actions to the console and exits with success even if no process
#      is found.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
